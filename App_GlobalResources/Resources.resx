    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>Here you will learn more about video interviews. What exactly is a video interview? How is it any different from video chat? And how can you use video interviews to make the best hiring decisions? &lt;br&gt;
What is a Video Interview? &lt;br&gt;
A video interview uses online video technology to allow job seekers and employers to connect earlier and easy. Video interviews take place remotely and use video technology as the communication medium. Since so much communication occurs at the nonverbal level, seeing and being seen is extremely important. And video interviews give people a better way to present themselves, both verbally and nonverbally. &lt;br&gt;
Video Interviews vs. Video Chat&lt;br&gt;
Video interviews are pretty much the same thing as video chat, right? Wrong. Video chat platforms were created just for that: for chat. Video interview platforms, on the other hand, are designed specifically for the interview process, from screening candidates to collaborating on hiring decisions. &lt;br&gt;
Types of Video Interviews&lt;br&gt;
Not all video interviews are equal. The following are the two major types of online interviewing: &lt;br&gt;
Live Video Interviews&lt;br&gt;
You don't want to spend time and money during the interview process? Look no further than live video interviews. These interviews work just like traditional face-to-face, minus travel costs and all the time it takes to schedule. &lt;br&gt;
Now, without any installation of bulky desktop software, employers and job seekers can spark a connection whenever and wherever. It’s video interview collaboration made easy. &lt;br&gt;
Recorded Video Interviews&lt;br&gt;
What is a Recorded video interview? This form of interviewing allow to create a series of interview questions, which job candidates then record their video answers to. &lt;br&gt;

Job candidates use the video format to answer interview questions while showing off their impressive communication skills, personality, and professionalism. What’s more, this form of virtual interviewing gives companies the ability to customize how much time candidates have to think before giving an answer. &lt;br&gt;
How can you use video interviews to make the best hiring decisions? &lt;br&gt;
Finding the perfect job fit isn’t always easy. Finding someone who can fit in with your company’s unique culture can be even harder. Live Interview solutions can help hiring professionals and take better hiring decisions. Here’s how: &lt;br&gt;
Save valuable time and money. &lt;br&gt;
Screening job candidates can take a huge chunk of your time and money. Video interviews make the process much easy by enabling you to connect with candidates face-to-face without having to meet them. When it comes to screening candidates, save time and avoid scheduling headaches with recorded video interviews. &lt;br&gt;
Gain better insight early on. &lt;br&gt;
Anyone can sound good in a phone interview or CV. Video interviews, however, allow you to pick up on visual cues that can impact your decision. See much more of the candidate earlier in the hiring process, from their facial expressions and body language to their personality and professionalism. Never be surprised in an in-person interview again! &lt;br&gt;
Collaborate with colleagues. &lt;br&gt;
When it comes time to screen candidates or bring them in for an in-person interview, not everyone needed can always be present. And interview notes and recollections aren’t an accurate representation of a job candidate. With video interviews, interview recordings can be shared with colleagues. On top of that, they can comment and rate candidates so you all come to a better hiring decision. &lt;br&gt;</value>

  </data>
  <data name="whyOnlineInterviewFutureDescription" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Flexibility&lt;br&gt;
Who wants to be tied to a schedule all the time? Video interviewing allows you to recruit or interview on the go! For instance, Live Interview offers a convenient video interviewing mobile app allowing job seekers to record interviews no matter where they are. Now you can view your top candidates from a boardroom, a train car or even poolside! &lt;br&gt;
Cost-Saving&lt;br&gt;
Online video interviews are a great way to save money. For one, they free up more time by making even the toughest to reach passive candidates available at the click of a button. They also cut travel cost by as much as 67%!&lt;br&gt;
Embracing Visuals&lt;br&gt;
Visual media is the wave of the future. After all a picture is worth a thousand words, even online. Using virtual interviews allows you to see and hear from your candidates faster and evaluate whether the candidate is right for the position. &lt;br&gt;
For the job seeker, online interviewing allows them to demonstrate those all-important communication skills with ease. Now you can put all your drive, ambition, and personality on display earlier in the hiring process. As an employer, video interviews are building a faster bridge between posting the job and finding the perfect candidate&lt;br&gt;</value>

  <data name="enhancingSocialMediaPositionDescription" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;Social media platforms provide an opportunity for your company to share information about your organization and its message. You can also get information about your open positions in front of interested job seekers. It's important to consider establishing a presence on multiple social channels so you can ensure your positions are reaching the broadest possible audience. However, you should first determine what your hiring needs are and identify the types of jobs you will need to fill. From there, decide which social media sites to utilize in order to get in front of your target applicants. If you are in retail, you might want to look on a more casual site like Facebook for potential employees. If you're looking to hire a director of sales or marketing specialist, LinkedIn may be the way to go.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your employer brand is an important factor for creating a positive candidate experience and attracting the right people to your company. Social media and video interviewing technology are giving companies more opportunities to improve, maintain, or stick to a consistent branding message. Studies have actually found that social media use makes employer brands more attractive to potential candidates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is critical that your company have consistency across all of its social media and video interviewing platforms. Whether it's your Twitter account or video interviewing hub, they should all tell the same story and be instantly recognizable so that candidates aren&amp;rsquo;t confused by multiple messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create an employer brand that's not only informative, but fun and enticing as well. Share pictures from around your office and of company outings. And don't be afraid to show off your best people by highlighting employees. Live Interview allows you to customize your video interviewing portal with company colors and logos, plus videos to promote your brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies should take advantage of social media platforms by accessing potential hires&amp;rsquo; public profiles to judge professionalism and thought leadership skills. This is a great way to separate top-notch candidates from problem hires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Video interviewing is a convenient, efficient, and affordable way to connect personally with candidates. Combine that with your social media strategies and you'll be well on your way to attracting top candidates to your company. You will no longer judge a candidate solely based on their resume that you may only look at for just a few seconds. With social media recruiting and video interviews, you will have a fuller and more comprehensive portrait of that candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By engaging with candidates on social media by talking about industry topics and replying to questions, you can build up a personal connection before an application or interview. This is why one-third of hiring managers and recruiters say social media recruiting sped up their hiring process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utilizing either the Live or Recorded video interview on Live Interview, will enable you to connect with candidates on a more personal level without wasting time talking to the wrong people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a large amount of people who use social media everyday to share and get their information, therefore, it is no wonder that more companies are realizing the benefits of utilizing this technology for sourcing, connecting with, and evaluation promising candidates.

    <value>&lt;p&gt;To gain a better understanding of the impact video interviews have on the candidate experience, here are some simple explanations to some of today&amp;rsquo;s widely-asked questions: &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do candidates like video interviews? &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short answer is yes. According to a recent study of 400 job seekers, nearly half of respondents with prior video interview experience prefer them to other long-distance interview formats (like the phone interview). That&amp;rsquo;s saying a lot, considering that video interviews are still regarded as a relatively new interview format. &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what exactly do candidates like about video interviews? &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They&amp;rsquo;re convenient&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of all, video interviews are convenient for all parties involved. Not only do they eliminate the need to plan the interview around multiple schedules, but they also make it easy for candidates to interview from anywhere, on any device, at any time - even while on the go. &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By making the interview process more flexible, candidates can save time and travel costs associated with traditional interview methods. &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They&amp;rsquo;re easy to use&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Video has taken over multiple aspects of our personal and professional lives, from how we stay in touch with loved ones to how we interview candidates for open positions. And because video chat platforms play such a prominent role in our lives, candidates often feel comfortable interviewing via video. The newest generation of job seekers is familiar with the technology and comfortable appearing on camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for older generations of workers, who may not be as comfortable with video technology, video interviews are designed to be very user-friendly. If you can manage to play and record YouTube videos or Skype with a buddy, you can figure out video interviewing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They create more possibilities&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is especially true for long-distance job candidates. Live video interviews make face-to-face interviews with faraway candidates possible, thus attracting global applicants. Both Live and Recorded video interviews make it possible to visually connect with candidates you might not otherwise get a chance to meet in person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do video interviews reflect on the company?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Screening job candidates and conducting employment interviews via video reflects well on a company. For starters, when it comes to the candidate experience, video interviews paint companies as innovative, current, and tech-savvy. As a result, hiring professionals can expect to attract equally creative and tech-savvy applicants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, more options means more candidates. Giving the opportunity to interview via video makes it easier for long-distance candidates to take part in the interview process, which can help boost a company&amp;rsquo;s employment brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do video interviews help or hurt the candidate experience?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, the candidate experience is as good as you make it. But video interviews can help make the experience stand out for job candidates. They are convenient, easy, and exciting for candidates and hiring professionals alike. However, used incorrectly, video interviews can make for a negative candidate experience during the interview process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to creating a positive candidate experience with video interviews is to combat candidate apprehensions early on. By using a platform designed specifically for video interviews, hiring professionals can rest assured that candidates are experiencing limited connectivity issues and top-notch audio/quality.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

  </data>
  <data name="howToRepresentYorBrandDescription" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;Your employer brand - your reputation as an employer - can either make or break a candidate&amp;rsquo;s decision to join your team. While an attractive employer brand can bring in more job applicants than you can handle, a not-so-attractive employer brand can leave your job positions vacant for weeks or months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interview serves as the perfect platform to showcase your unique employer brand. It&amp;rsquo;s easy enough to showcase your employer brand during an in-person interview with a tour of the office, face-to-face introductions, and the like, but how do you showcase employer brand when the interview takes place in a virtual setting?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether candidates are taking part in a recorded or live video interview, one advantage video interviews have over in-person interviews is the ability to brand the overall experience. Live Interview, for instance, enables companies to upload their company logo and video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These customization options put your company and employer brand front and center during the actual interview, which serves as a valuable reminder for candidates throughout the video interview experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Including a video introduction before candidates begin their video interview is a great way to feature your company culture and employer brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video can take a look at &amp;ldquo;a day in the life&amp;rdquo; of the company&amp;rsquo;s employees, include a tour of the office, or feature testimonials from the people who know your employer brand the best: your employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important thing is to put your employer brand on display for candidates taking part in a video interview since they can&amp;rsquo;t yet physically tour the office or shake hands with employees.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

    <value>&lt;p&gt;An efficient hiring process is crucial if you want to avoid having empty positions for weeks or even just a few days. According to the Society of Human Resource Management, it typically takes between 29 and 43 days to hire a new employee. That&amp;rsquo;s far too long, especially if you need rockstar talent right away to help your company grow. Achieving an efficient hiring process means ditching traditional hiring methods that waste time and improving hiring team collaboration so that decisions about a candidate can be made faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Video interviews, particularly the Live interview, are powerful tech solutions that allow companies to quickly reach a hiring decision. When you&amp;rsquo;ve found a great candidate, you need to move fast before someone from the competition to steal them from you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have probably even used a live video chat platform before; whether it be Google Hangouts, Skype, or Facetime, so you are already familiar with the concept. The main difference between live video chats and live video interviews is that video interviews are specifically designed for the recruiting or hiring process.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

    <value>&lt;p&gt;In order to make the most of your video interviewing utilization, you need to first establish your game plan by identifying your hiring goals. What are the types of jobs you need to fill within the next few months or year? After you determine this, you can then implement the following tips into your video interviewing strategy to bring in amazing talent to join your team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be transparent about your hiring process with candidates&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the popularity of video interviewing has grown significantly in the past few years, there are still companies not yet utilizing this technology. Therefore, there are job seekers out there who may not be familiar with this method of interviewing. You should take the time to inform your candidates about the role video interviews play in your hiring process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start off the interview process by asking the candidate if they have ever been interviewed over video. If it is their first time being interviewed in this manner, take some time to explain everything about the process and what they are to expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recorded interview offers candidates plenty of flexibility since they are the ones who decide when to get it done within a given timeframe. However, you don&amp;rsquo;t want to offset this advantage by giving too short of a deadline for the interview. You&amp;rsquo;ll want to give your candidates 5-7 days to record their responses. This is a sufficient amount of time for them to become familiar with the video interviewing platform and test out their equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take advantage of branding opportunities&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The importance of candidate experience cannot be stressed enough. As you strive to hire top-notch talent, it is important to develop a positive appearance for your company as an employer. Be sure not to ignore branding opportunities while video interviewing. Seeing your company logo and color scheme will allow candidates to experience a consistent and branded video interview. They won&amp;rsquo;t be left wondering what organization they are interviewing with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, video interviews can be one component of an overall company brand that conveys a considerate, innovative impression to potential employees and can significantly help with attracting great talent. A video interviewing initiative instantly shows candidates that your company is willing to embrace new technology. &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best practices for conducting a live interview:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check your Internet connection and equipment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as you would expect a candidate to prepare for a live interview, so should you. It&amp;rsquo;s important that you check your Internet connection, webcam, and mic beforehand so as to avoid any mishaps in the middle of the interview.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While you can carry out a successful live interview over wireless internet, we recommend connecting to the internet using an ethernet cable for better performance. You will also want to close any programs and web browsers that you won&amp;rsquo;t be needing to conduct your live video interview as these can take resources away and slow down your device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your webcam is obviously a crucial part of having a successful video interview. Make sure that it is connected to your computer and close out any programs that might be utilizing it (e.g. Skype or FaceTime). Most webcams come with a built-in microphone, however, if you decide to use a stand-alone mic or headset, double-check to make sure the mic is connected to your computer. Again, close out any programs that might be utilizing the mic prior to the interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mind the surrounding noise, background, and lighting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where you choose to conduct your video interview is very important. A video interview can be done pretty much anywhere, however, you need to keep in mind the surround.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

  <data name="liBetterHiringDescription" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;Typically takes companies at least a month to hire a new employee. Forcing candidates to wait that long for a decision may leave a bad impression thinking about your company and they could decide to look for work elsewhere. For companies to reach hiring decisions faster, it could mean simply enhancing their hiring team collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order for a hiring decision to be made, the input of other colleagues may be required. However, having to juggle the schedules of multiple people when arranging an interview with a candidate can be very difficult, if not impossible. Additionally, there may be instances when something comes up at the last minute and a colleague or two can't be present for a candidate&amp;rsquo;s scheduled interview. With recorded live video interviews you can easy getting your colleagues caught up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Live video interviews work just like their three dimensional counterparts, only without the travel costs and hassle of scheduling a traditional in-person interview. Moreover, a recorded interview can easily be shared with your colleagues and played back at any time. If a colleague couldn&amp;rsquo;t be there in-person and they're instrumental to the decision, they will still be able to get a good feel for a candidate's potential fit and qualifications and weigh in on whether to move forward with them or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better hiring team collaboration also means you can ensure that a smart hiring decision is being made every time. A bad hire decision can cost your company significantly. If you're able to collaborate more easily, you'll be able to also do so faster. This means that important hiring decisions can be reached quickly, allowing you to extend job offers to talented candidates before other companies can get to them.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

  <data name="organizationAndSelectionDescription" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;Having a great organizational is a smart way to not only keep employees engaged and motivated, but also a smart way to attract top candidates. The movers and shakers you want to target with your recruitment strategy are the same people looking for companies with great perks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not sold yet on how essential a good organizational culture is for top talent recruitment? Here are some reasons why you can't afford to ignore company culture:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video interview can give you a clearer picture of a candidate's personality, ambition, and career goals. Using the video interview, you should evaluate whether a candidate will fit like a glove into your current culture. Ask questions about how they work with others and what their ideal office environment would be like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real benefit of the video interview, however, is its ability to get you a more personal view of candidates faster than in the traditional recruitment process. By watching a job seeker's recorded video interview answers, you can weed ill-fitting candidates out of the pile of applications and focus only on the candidates who will be a good match for your organization. This helps you cut down on candidates who won't fit into your organizational and will flee your company at the first sign of a better offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using video interviews helps to brand your company as an organization embracing new technology. You're showing the company is receptive to new ideas and new ways of approaching common problems. It helps brand your company culture as a place open to new concepts and innovation. In turn, this company brand will be more likely to attract smart candidates with big ideas on how to innovate and grow your organization.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

    <value>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recorded video interviews: which is the best way to screen candidates?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="recordedVideoInterviewDescription" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;You have an extraordinarily high volume of job candidates to screen and want to narrow down your candidate numbers and identify the best possible job fit, you have to screen each and every qualified applicant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Screening candidates before inviting them to take part in a formal, in-person interview is a necessary, especially when you consider the fact that an average of 250 resumes are received for each corporate job opening. With recorded video interviews, in which candidates record their answers to a series of text or video-based questions in a pre-determined amount of time, screening doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be tedious or time-consuming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connecting with Candidates&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both recorded video interviews and phone interviews give you an opportunity to ask questions and gain more insight on a candidate&amp;rsquo;s ability to fulfill the duties of a particular position. But that&amp;rsquo;s where the similarities end. Unlike phone interviews, video interviews give you a more complete picture of a candidate. Instead of relying on a candidate&amp;rsquo;s tone of voice to assess their interest, personality, and professionalism, recorded video interviews enable you to pick up on important visual cues, such as facial expressions and body language, that can potentially impact a hiring decision. With recorded video interviews, you're able to see what you&amp;rsquo;re going to get before the candidate ever steps foot in the office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scheduling the Initial Interview&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nature of recorded video interviews takes the hassle out of the scheduling process. In fact, it takes very little scheduling to screen candidates via video. Create a list of interview questions you&amp;rsquo;d like answered, send out a link to the interview platform, and watch interview recordings at your convenience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With recorded video interviews you can ensure that all candidates are being asked exactly the same thing and that they&amp;rsquo;re given the same amount of time to prepare and deliver their answers, thus leveling the playing field. What&amp;rsquo;s more, interview recordings can be paused and played back as many times as necessary, which makes it easier to fairly evaluate candidates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collaborating on Hiring Decisions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than relying on cluttered interview notes or verbal play-by-plays to assess candidates, video interview recordings can be shared with others so that they can make their own unbiased decisions.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

  </data>
  <data name="theBenefitDescription" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;What is the benefit in using online video interviewing? There are many reasons why a virtual interview can streamline the hiring process. We all know the traditional hiring process can sometimes be a headache. Video interviewing helps to clear away some of the mess in the process, making your overall recruitment efforts more effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Way Things Are Done Now&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we talk about how to improve hiring efficiency through the use of video interviews, let&amp;rsquo;s first take a peek behind the hiring curtain. The way things are currently done in the recruitment process leads companies and recruiters to spend valuable time and money.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two largest money-taking in the hiring process are time and travel. Depending on the job and the candidate, some companies are willing to fly top talent out for an interview. This can lead to big time costs, with no guarantee the candidate will turn into an employee.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Travel isn&amp;rsquo;t the only part of the traditional process depleting your accounts. Recruiters and hiring managers spend plenty of precious time trying to find the best people for the job. The average recruiter spends about 15 hours per week sourcing for candidates.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get More Effective With Video Interviews&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online interviews can help you cut down on the traditional hiring process and save your company time and money. How does online interviewing help? For one thing, it streamlines the hiring process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, employers can watch candidates answer their questions wherever and whenever they want. Realize a candidate isn't right for the position early on? Now you're not trapped on the phone. This is one of the main reasons many recruiters are adopting video interviews.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Live video interviewing is great for far-flung and passive candidates. Now you can save 100% of your travel costs by just booting up your webcam. Plus, scheduling interviews with passive candidates can often be difficult. While you want the best candidates in front of you, they're often times busy too if they&amp;rsquo;re currently employed. Now both hiring managers and candidates can schedule a face-to-face interview without endless back and forth on scheduling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's be honest, we're living in a digital age. Consumers turn to the Web for everything from advice and entertainment to books and products. There is really nothing you can't find online. So, why not take advantage of new online recruitment suggestions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using online video interviewing shows potential hires your company understands the online marketplace. If you embrace emerging technology and new ways of approaching the hiring process, you'll attract talent with similar values.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

    <value>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tricky questions for video interviewing success&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="trickyQuestionsForVideoDescription" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;When it comes to finding the perfect candidate for your company's open positions, the interview is essential to discovering who has what it takes and who doesn't. The video interview is no different than an in-person meeting. Just because you're connecting with a candidate in a video interview, doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you should go easy on candidates. It's still important to ask tough interview questions in order to find out if your candidate is good in reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asking tough interview questions in the video interview allows you to see how candidates react and think. If you're connecting in a live video interview, you can see how candidates react in real-time and evaluate nonverbal communication cues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're connecting in a recorded video interview, you can and should still ask tough interview questions. Because a candidate has more time to prepare and re-record their answers, tough interview questions are needed to weed out the best candidates from the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully these interview tips will get you thinking up your own, company-specific questions, so you can find the perfect fitting candidate for your company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell me about yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of the most standard interview questions for a reason. A job seeker answering this question can tell you a surprising amount of information about themselves and their goals from the information they self-select to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start="2"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why should we hire you?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another one of the standard interview questions, this one helps you evaluate a candidate's confidence and skill match with the position. If, while watching the candidate on video, they seem stumped on how to answer why they're the absolute best person for the job, maybe it's because they aren't&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start="3"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What's your greatest career performance?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Situational interview questions ask candidates to use real-life examples from their own experiences to demonstrate value. This gives you a better idea of how their skills work in action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start="4"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell me about a big mistake, how you dealt with it, and what you learned from the experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, situational interview questions can tell you a lot about how candidates actually act and react in a real work environment. Asking situational interview questions about accomplishments is definitely important to be able to see candidates at their best. But remember, no person is on their best behavior all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mistakes happen, so it's also important to use situational interview questions to evaluate how candidates react when they've made a mistake. The mistake, the response, and the lesson learned can tell you a great deal about how the candidate approaches setbacks and how they deal with high-stress situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start="5"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why do you want this job?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another one of the standard interview questions, the answer to this can help you evaluate career aspirations. Is this just another paycheck to the candidate, or are they really interested in your company and industry? While they answer, look for sincere career passion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start="6"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where do you see yourself in five years?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is another one of the standard interview questions meant to evaluate career aspirations. You want a candidate who is willing to stick around in your organization since employee turnover is so expensive. But more than that, you want someone who is actually engaged and motivated by your position or industry. If the candidate sees themselves in a whole new industry or company five years later, they're probably not right for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start="7"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What type of work environment do you prefer?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This question is focused on company culture since 46 percent of small business new hires fail within the first 18 months. The reason? In 89 percent of the cases, it was a company culture mismatch. You can always train for skills, but finding someone to fit into your company culture is far more complex. Let the candidate tell you what kind of company culture they would prefer working in, so you can see if their ideal fits your company's reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start="8"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are your biggest weaknesses?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is truly a tough question to ask in the interview, but like the situational question about biggest mistakes, it can really tell you how the candidate approaches problems. Look for candidates who don't give you a rehearsed answer and instead pick a weakness they are addressing and have learned from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start="9"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell me about a time you went over and above to get a job done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer to this question tells you two important things. First, it's another chance for the candidate to make a great impression by showing you something really impressive. Second, it tells you what a candidate considers "above and beyond." If the example isn't all that impressive, perhaps it's because the candidate is the kind of employee who punches out at 5 p.m. on the dot and does only what's required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start="10"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do you evaluate success?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While not one of the standard interview questions, this query probably should be. It gives you a good idea of what the candidate is looking for in both their job and career. Are they looking for challenging work, more responsibilities, or just a bigger paycheck? Pay careful attention to how the candidate answers to see what they consider important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using some of these questions and interview tips can help you use the video interview to find the very best talent for your company.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

  </data>
  <data name="useVideoInterviewingDescription" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;The traditional hiring process can be a long road to travel. Video interviews are building a better bridge to circumvent all the traditional hiring roadblocks. For example there&amp;rsquo;s the endless resumes to review, the phone screens taking an average of 15 minutes per call, and at this point recruiters haven't even found their best candidates. Once you do you&amp;rsquo;re in for more interviews, you have to schedule those interviews with the candidate in person. Great! Now you have major scheduling difficulties to work around. No wonder the average position takes 30 days to fill. It&amp;rsquo;s a miracle it doesn&amp;rsquo;t take longer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For job seekers, the interviewing process can be no less painful. You&amp;rsquo;ll often have endless phone and in person interviews. This means scheduling, traveling, and maybe even taking time off work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online interviewing is a great way to shorten this process. Instead of swimming through the endless stream of resumes and interviews: build a bridge!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virtual interviews can help shorten the process between sorting through resumes and finding the perfect hire. For instance One-Way Interviews are a great way to cut out those time consuming preliminary phone screens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Job seekers can record answers to text-based interview questions posed by employers, showing off their communication skills, charisma, and qualifications. They can record these interviews on their own time, even from their mobile devices. Employers can then view these recorded video interviews whenever their schedule allows. No more 30 minutes wasted on a candidate an employer knows isn&amp;rsquo;t right in the first 90 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Video interviewing allows both job seekers and recruiters to save time so they only have to focus on the best opportunities. Instead of having dozens of qualified candidates in for interviews, only bring in the top prospects for an in-person meet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Video interviews can also work as a way to effectively shorten the hiring process for both job seekers and employers. Employers will spend less time sourcing candidates and more time focusing on the individuals right for the job. Job seekers can use video to interview for jobs both near and far without all the travel and scheduling difficulties. Online video is building a better bridge between the job application and finding the perfect fit.&lt;/p&gt;

  <data name="videoInterviewForHRDescription" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;Do you ever feel like your hiring process is a little&amp;hellip;out dated? Inefficient? Impersonal? If so, perhaps it is time to look into an innovative and effective solution like Live Interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not easy to rate by simply assessing the candidate by what they put on paper. But what about personality, enthusiasm, or professionalism?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By actually seeing candidates via video interviews, hiring managers are better able to make a connection with the resume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Video interviewing for HR allows hiring managers to put a face to the name on the paper. After all, how are hiring managers supposed to &amp;ldquo;see&amp;rdquo; greatness and potential through paper anyway? By enhancing the resume, video interviewing is used to help assess hiring needs, select the right candidates, and help retain top of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Video interviewing for HR as a form of early screening is by far more effective and allows employers to gain more insight on candidates. Plus, with the ability to share video interviews with team members, internal collaboration has never been easier than Live Interview&amp;rsquo;s comment and rating system. With these tools, HR can better validate their hires. Video interviews bring life to the screening process so hiring professionals can make better hiring decisions in order to retain employees for the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a way, video interviews allow hiring managers to &amp;ldquo;hear&amp;rdquo; what is not said when viewing text responses. Video interviewing for HR combines the benefits of the phone screen and the in-person interview to further evaluate candidate&amp;rsquo;s skills, attitudes and personalities.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

  </data>
  <data name="whichCaseVideoIsBestDescription" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, video interviews create a convenient, innovative, and interesting way for employers to connect with job seekers. But, most importantly, video interviews cater to unique tradition job interview situations that phone calls or face-to-face meetings just won&amp;rsquo;t work for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you have a high volume of candidates to screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For time-strapped hiring professionals, screening candidates is the necessary part of the hiring process, especially when you have a high volume of candidates to screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you have a large amount of candidates, spending a good 30 minutes on the phone with each is not an efficient use of time. Not when you can view 10 recorded video interviews in the same time it takes to perform a single phone conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recorded video interviews, in which candidates record their responses to a series of pre-determined questions, give screening an entirely new meaning. They not only give you an opportunity to connect with candidates visually, they&amp;rsquo;re also convenient. Instead of spending time for scheduling a phone calls around everyone&amp;rsquo;s busy schedules, recorded video interviews can be recorded and viewed on your own time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you need to interview long-distance candidates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to searching for top talent, sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s necessary to move beyond the confines of your own backyard. But attracting and connecting with faraway talent can be difficult, due to geographic and time zone barriers. That&amp;rsquo;s where video interviews come in to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By offering video interview options, you can expand your job candidates search to worldwide and attract candidates who might not otherwise apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you want to attract more passive candidates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passive candidates are in high demand. They appeal to companies because they&amp;rsquo;ve demonstrated their skills and expertise by thriving in similar positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you know a whopping 75% of professionals categorize themselves as &amp;ldquo;passive&amp;rdquo; candidates? In other words, three-fourths of professionals aren&amp;rsquo;t actively looking for a new position, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean they&amp;rsquo;re not open to other opportunities that might come their way. Getting in touch with the passive candidate about a job opportunity can be tricky due to their busy schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, video interviews make it easy to appeal to and attract passive candidates. For starters, passive candidates may not want to commit to commuting for a full-on job interview, but might be willing to take a few minutes to participate in a video interview. Given their busy schedules, passive candidates will appreciate the convenience and time-saving factors of video interviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you need to collaborate on hiring decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nature of video interviews makes hiring collaboration easier than ever, as no one has to be physically present at the time of the interview. Colleagues and clients alike can be sent video interview recordings to view and assess well after the interview has taken place. These video recordings make it easy for everyone to collaborate, which ensures that you&amp;rsquo;re making more informed hiring decisions. Better collaboration means better hires.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

    <value>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Administrative professionals: Hiring the best with Live Interview&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="administrativeProfessionalsDescription" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;Great administrative professionals keep your company running smoothly. Whether you're hiring an administrative assistant, a human resource manager, or a labor relations specialist, you need to ensure your company finds the best person. These professionals keep your office running&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet many companies overlook these necessary positions in their quest to hire the best people. If your organization is dropping on hiring great administrative professionals, you might soon find yourself left down. From entry-level administrative support to manager human resources, these are the employees that keep your organization running at full speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You cannot ignore the importance of hiring someone with the right personality for the job. A good administrative assistant will fit into your company culture with ease, but more importantly their personality will mesh with the executives or managers they are assisting. If you skimp on the interview process, you might just find yourself with a skilled candidate your executives just do not enjoy working with. You need to find both top-notch skills and a great personality when it comes to hiring the right personal assistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video interview can help in this search by connecting you faster and more personally with great administrative assistant candidates, all without wasting too much time talking to the wrong people. Thanks to the recorded video interview, companies can watch prospective administrative professionals answer written questions on video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This way, only the candidates with the right personality and skills make it to the next level of the interviewing process. This allows executives and managers to waste less of their time and only connect with the best candidates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video interview can help you easily see which of your candidates have the right tech skills for our increasingly digital world. Candidates who can integrate a video resume into their social media profiles, for instance, are probably more tech-savvy than those sending in the same old email attachments. And those candidates who don&amp;rsquo;t bother to stage the backgrounds in their video interview show they're not thinking with the digital stage in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding the right administrative support isn't always easy, whether you're looking for a top-notch administrative assistant or an HR superstar. Utilizing the video interview can help you connect more personally and assess skills more easily, leading to the best hires possible.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

    <value>&lt;p&gt;If you're spending all your time on hiring, odds are you're losing valuable time and money which would be better spent elsewhere. You need to find great employees who fit into your corporate culture and will be excited about growing with the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utilizing the video interview, hiring managers in the food services industry can find employees more likely to stick around with less time wasted. This is good news not just for your bottom line, but also for your customer service and employee morale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Hiring Challenges Face the Restaurant Industry?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiring great managers, servers, and staff for your restaurant isn't always easy. The harder part, however, is retaining good employees once you have them. Using a video interview can be a better way to connect with interested applicants without wasting tons of time interviewing applicants who just aren't right for the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recorded virtual interview allows hiring managers to see job seekers before spending real face-to-face time in the their presence. One of the main reasons for the high employee turnover in the food services industry is because employers end up hiring for skills instead of for corporate culture fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of wasting time talking to job seekers who just won't fit in, using a recorded virtual interview is a fast way to tell immediately if a candidate is right for your company. In the recorded interview, employers pose written questions job seekers answer on film. If you know the potential server or manager is all wrong for the job, you can click out of the video without having wasted any scheduling an in-person interview. Plus, if you just don't have the time to have a stream of job seekers traipsing into your restaurant, you can connect with applicants in real time using live video interviews.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

    <value>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Executive management hiring: 3 video interviewing tips &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="executiveManagementHiringDescription" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;Executive management candidates can truly make a large difference in your organization, your company culture, and your company's bottom line. These executives will be driving your company forward, so you need to hire the very best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need a better way to hire for executive management positions, so you don't end up footing the bill for costly employee turnover. Thankfully, the video interview can be your solution by helping you connect with executives personally, find the right skills, and shorten your process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are three tips for using the video interview to hire the executives your company needs and reduce employee turnover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connect Personally&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to hiring the right executives for your company, finding the right fit is extremely important. Beyond skills, you need to find someone who aligns with your company's mission statement, someone with the right drive and determination for the job, and someone who can improve your company culture and move your organization forward. So, it makes sense to try to connect personally with these top management candidates sooner in the process. The video interview allows you to do so, making it simple to connect personally from the first moments of the process. Whether you're connecting in a live or recorded video interview, this new tech tool makes it easier to evaluate personality, communication skills, and overall fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find The Right Skills&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recruiting a top management candidate or CEO requires a very particular and refined set of skills. These skills won't always be simple to find, and the candidates with the right stuff might lie beyond your company's geographical comfort zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With video interviewing, you can connect with these far-flung candidates simply, effectively, and cheaply. Instead of spending money on plane tickets and hotels, you can connect face-to-face in a live video interview. This way you can find the executives, CEO candidates, and top management talent you need while saving money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easier Coordination&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you're hiring a CEO or a senior executive, coordination and communication are key. It&amp;rsquo;s important for both hiring managers and staffing professionals to coordinate with the internal management team in order to make a good senior level hire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Video interviewing can help communication with even the busiest management team. For instance, recorded video interviews have candidates answer questions on video. These video answers can then be viewed at any time, by a staffing company or by an internal management team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recruiting top-notch executive management talent isn't always easy. But if you want to avoid employee turnover, hire great people, and find new leaders to move your company forward you need to look to new solutions. The video interview can be the key, helping you coordinate efforts, find the right people, and connect personally with the very best.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

    <value>&lt;p&gt;Whether you're looking to hire someone to deal with accounting services or financial security, the truth is many companies have taken a hit since the recession. This means you probably need these financial services professionals more than ever, while simultaneously battling a smaller hiring budget.&lt;/p&gt;

  <data name="findingBetterRetail" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding better retail industry employees with Live Interview&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="findingBetterRetailDescription" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;In the retail sector, employee turnover is a huge concern. We all know great employees are hard to find, so it can be even more heartbreaking when they leave your retail organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether it's a hard-working store employee, manager, or cashier, your retail organization needs a good employees. Hiring workers who will be the right for the job is difficult, which is why more companies are turning to the video interview to find it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, six out of 10 companies are currently utilizing the video interview in their hiring practices to find the right people. So what are the main concerns facing the retail industry and how can the video interview help your company acquire top talent interested in sticking around? Let's take a look at some of these concerns. &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Challenges in the Retail Industry and Hiring:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before looking at how the video interview can provide solutions for reducing employee turnover, we first need to look into the hiring issues facing the retail industry. Because many of those employed in retail jobs are part-time workers, turnover is a huge concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These employees don't feel as if they're part of the organizational family and often left when better opportunities present themselves. Many retail employees aren't looking for career jobs but merely jobs to help pay the bills right now. So instead of looking forward to a long career in the organization and moving up the corporate ladder, these employees are looking forward to nothing more than their next paycheck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the major benefits of video interviewing is the ability to see more job seekers in a shorter amount of time. For instance, in a recorded virtual interview, employers pose written questions job seekers then answer on video. These video responses give employers a personal feel for the candidate, while allowing the interview process to be more portable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because employers can view these job seekers' responses at any time, these interviews can be worked around even the most busy schedule. Plus, you can watch 10 video screens in the amount of time it takes to perform one phone screen! For an industry with high turnover like the retail industry, this is a great way to save time while hiring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Job seekers who fit into your corporate culture will be more likely to stick around than those who just aren't the right fit. In the video interview, pose interview questions to find out what your candidate's ideal corporate culture would look like. Make sure you are very, very honest about what your retail organization's corporate culture is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember you can always train for skills, but it's much harder to fit a square job seeker into the round hole of your corporate culture. Those who fit into your organizational environment will be more likely to stick around and reduce your employee turnover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many retail employees are leaving their jobs, and the sector, because they just don't see a viable career path. They're not leaving for high salaries, they're leaving for increased professional opportunities. So if you want to keep more of your top performers around, offer a viable career path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use your interviewing opportunity to express exactly how a the candidate can turn from a part-time or hourly employee into an organizational all star. Offering a clear career path directly in the video interview, as opposed to just a job, will make your hires more likely to stick around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employee turnover can be very costly in the retail industry, which is why you should embrace video interviewing to help you hire workers who will grow with your company.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

  <data name="freelanceJobs" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Freelance jobs using Live Interview &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="freelanceJobsDescription" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;The freelancer economy is going strong, with more and more professionals go whit non-traditional work schedules. Most of this has been spurned by the weak economy, forcing candidates to get more creative and think outside the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For employers, the allure of hiring someone to do freelance work is pretty evident. These are qualified professionals who can help your company grow, scale, and bring a well-developed skill set to the table. You might need someone to do some freelance writing or freelance marketing on a one-time project basis, making it inefficient to hire someone in-house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiring great candidates to do freelance work is also a great way to form a ready-made proving ground for candidates you might want to take on for more long-term employment. Instead of trusting the references on their resume or the work in their portfolio, you can see what they're really made of by evaluating the projects they turn in as a freelance employee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do you find top-notch candidates for your freelance jobs? Live interview can be a great way to fill your empty freelance jobs with talented and qualified candidates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best things about video interviews is the ability to connect personally with a candidate. Whether you're looking for someone to do some freelance writing or freelance photography, you'll want to connect just like you would with any other candidate you'd bring into the company fold. Just because a candidate is freelancing, after all, doesn't mean it no longer becomes important for them to fit into the overall company culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The candidate is still representing your company, even if you're only hiring them to do a little freelance writing for the company website. You need someone who understands the company and, more importantly, someone you trust to deliver top-quality work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We mentioned before that some companies use freelance work as the basis for evaluating candidates they might want to bring on full-time. So it's important to start making sure a candidate fits into the company culture as early as the hiring process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using video interviews, you can connect personally with the best and brightest candidates. In a live video interview, you can connect face-to-face in the same personal way you would if they were sitting across the desk from you. Best of all, you can then share the best candidates with your whole team.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

    <value>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hiring great sales representatives with Live Interview &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</value>

  <data name="hiringGreatSalesDescription" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;Obviously, hiring the best sales representative you possibly can is important. A recent study revealed in a business-to-business environment the caliber of sales representative is the most influential factor when it comes to buying decisions. A good sales representative can literally make or break your business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;64 % of sales representatives fail because they're just not right for the jobл Hiring is essential when it comes to putting together a strong sales team for your organization, and the video interview can be the right tool to ensure you hire only the most talented job seekers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These jobs prize superior communication skills, and the video interview will allow you to evaluate such skills faster and with less fuss. For instance, instead of doing several phone interviews back to back to evaluate communication skills, you can instead compile a list of great interview questions and send this list to all of your candidates. Then you can have your candidates answers these tough interview questions on video in a recorded interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recorded interview, job seekers answer an employer's written interview questions on video. These video interview answers can then be viewed at any time by your hiring team. Now you can judge personality and communication skills without ever wasting time with the wrong candidate. When it becomes time to select candidates for a more personal live video interview, you can select only the candidates with personalities aggressive and confident enough to make a good sales representative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here are just a few of the tough interview questions you should be asking during a live or one-way virtual interview in order to find the best people:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you prefer a long or short sales cycle?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you like least about being in sales?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes you a good sales representative?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tell me about your career goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These tough interview questions will allow you to find out more about what your sales candidate knows and what kind of fit they will be for your open jobs. By focusing on knowledge and career goals, you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to discover just how serious this candidate is about pursuing a career in the sales field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Video interviews can be a great way of finding the top candidate you need for your sales team without wasting time and energy in the hiring process.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

    <value>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hiring great technology employees with Live Interview&amp;nbsp; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</value>

  <data name="hiringGreatTechnologyDescription" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;Thanks to a tech worker shortage and the skills gap, it's actually harder than ever to find the right people you need for your open positions. Despite the high unemployment rate, finding the right people for technology sector jobs is still a real challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is because, while the unemployed job seekers is large, those who can perform these highly skilled tech jobs is actually fairly small. The skills gap between the qualifications employers need and the qualifications job seekers have feels like it gets wider all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video interview can be a great tool for connecting with the best candidates and scooping them up before your competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the unemployment rate for all job seekers hovers at around 7 percent, the unemployment rate for those in the IT industry and technological fields is a paltry 4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's tough out there in the job market...unless you work in technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the high demand, the best tech job seekers are likely to have packed schedules. Your company might find a great passive candidate who would be perfect for your open position, but finding time to schedule a conventional interview is another story. Not only is this passive candidate in high demand, but also it's likely their schedule will make a face-to-face sit down hard to come by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a great example of how the video interview can help your company scoop up top candidate. That passive candidate who doesn't have time to commute out to your office just might have time to squeeze a video interview into their packed schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a live video interview, you can connect with the passive candidate in real time just like in a traditional interview. However, because these interviews can be performed from anywhere, even the busiest passive candidate can make time to connect via webcam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you can jump the skills gap by isolating talent and connecting with these individuals faster than in the traditional process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also use recorded interviews, where employers present job seekers with typed questions to answer on video. These are much faster and more efficient than phone screens, and will allow you to see if your in-demand tech worker is likely to leave the company due to a cultural mismatch.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

    <value>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to answer - popular video interview questions &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="howToAnswerDescription" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;How do you go about answering the recorded interview questions? You definitely want to seize this opportunity to show the employer or hiring manager that you are a good fit for the job and that you are sincerely interested in the company and position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below you will find several of the more popular questions employer and hiring managers ask in recorded interviews along with tips on how you can form great responses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why are you interested in this position?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take this opportunity to talk about how your past experiences have helped to prepare you for this job. You should also mention any success you experienced in a previous position that will show that you are the right candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you know about our company?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no reason that you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to answer this question. Thanks to the internet, you can easily find anything you need to know about a company. The employer or hiring manager is asking this to see if you&amp;rsquo;ve done your research prior to the interview, therefore, make certain that you do. Research the company by browsing their website, reading articles about their accomplishments, and checking out their social media accounts (if any) to get an idea of their company culture. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to recite every single fact you find, but make sure you mention at least some of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The type of product or service the company sells&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How long the company has been in business&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&amp;rsquo;s recent accomplishments&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the company culture is like and how it relates to your values and personality&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are your strengths?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your response should relate to the job description and your ability to perform the tasks assigned to you. For example, if you are being interviewed for a position where you will be leading a large group of people discuss your strong communication skills and ability to work with a variety of people and personalities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where do you see yourself in 5 years?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no perfect answer to this question because responses will vary depending on the industry and the individual. A employer or hiring manager simply wants to find out how well you plan ahead and if your goals match those of the company. It&amp;rsquo;s important, though, to avoid saying anything that makes you seem abrasive, short-term minded, or lacking in goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is your ideal work environment?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This question is asked so a employer or hiring manager can determine if you&amp;rsquo;d be a good fit for a company&amp;rsquo;s culture. Be honest in your response. If you would work well in a large, bustling office, say so. If you prefer working in a small office so you can easily collaborate with colleagues, explain why this is important to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Describe your work ethic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, this question is asked to find out how well you can fit into a company&amp;rsquo;s culture. Describe how important it is to you to complete all of the tasks assigned to you effectively and efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tell me about yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t answer this question by rambling on about your hobbies and your pets. Use this as another opportunity to direct the employer or hiring manager&amp;rsquo;s attention to your skills and accomplishment to really impress them. Talk about what interests you about the industry and what you hope to bring to their organization.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

  </data>
  <data name="lookingGoodDescription" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;Some tips that may not immediately come to mind for video interviewing preparation that the infographic highlights are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have light facing you - not behind you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is necessary because when light hits a webcam, it will compensate by going dark and you&amp;rsquo;ll end up looking like a faceless shadow. Consider having two lamps surround either side of your face to really make you look good on camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Center yourself&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s important that you position yourself in the center of the webcam. Make sure all of your head, neck, and shoulders can be seen. You should also be aware of your posture. If something bothering you or you feel uncomfortable, the employer/hiring manager reviewing your interview may get the vibe that you&amp;rsquo;re not very interested in the position or that you&amp;rsquo;re a timid person; not usually traits people are looking for in employees.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you choose to wear for a video interview is also important&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go about picking an outfit the way you would if you were meeting an employer in person. Choose clothes that fit you well; nothing baggy or too tight. Furthermore, be sure to dress appropriately from head-to-toe. In a recorded interview, you&amp;rsquo;ll most likely be seated the whole time, but wearing a complete set outfit can help you to focus and maintain the state-of-mind needed for having a successful interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also keep the following in mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoid white&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people will equate white clothing with looking clean and very presentable. That can work for in-person interviews, but on camera white is not a wise choice. White clothing will appear brighter on camera and may overpower your face, potentially making eye contact difficult. Instead, choose darker colors like navy and avoid patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoid too much/flashy jewelry&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While you may think that new necklace would go perfectly with your cardigan, it&amp;rsquo;s best to wear minimal jewelry for a video interview. You should also stay away from especially shiny jewelry that could catch the light on camera.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t forget the basics&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A video interview is no less formal than an in-person interview, so men, don&amp;rsquo;t think you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have a clean-shaven face. And women, keep your makeup minimal and conservative.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

    <value>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Staffing solutions: using Live Interview to hire the best candidates &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="staffingSolutionsDescription" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;As a staffing industry professional, you know finding the best candidates isn't easy. Since the economic recession, companies have fewer openings, which mean competition between staffing agencies can be downright fierce. You need to ensure your staffing agency rises above the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Live Interview can be a great way to give your staffing agency a competitive edge, and ensure you get the clients you need to thrive. You need to stay ahead of the competition and that means finding the best candidates and finding them fast. Companies are looking for staffing solutions, and the video interview can be a great way to cut costs and cut down on time, while never giving up on candidate quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employers don't just need any candidate, they need highly and specifically skilled workers. These people, unsurprisingly, are hard to find even in times of high unemployment. Video interviews can help by allowing your staffing agency to connect personally much faster than in the traditional hiring process. Instead of endless back-and-forth through email trying to schedule a meeting, you can meet in real time with a live video interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will ensure your staffing agency doesn't lose out on top candidates, because your competitors have scooped up the most highly skilled workers while you were still trying to schedule an in-person sit down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Temporary Staffing Solution&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most companies looking toward staffing agencies for help filling temporary jobs are looking to do so swiftly. A benefit of video interviewing is it helps cut the fat out of the traditional hiring process, shortening time to hire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of an average of 30 minutes on a phone screen with someone who could be all wrong for the job, the recorded video interview allows you to quickly sort through your temporary staffing options. This way, you can hone in on only the best candidates and get this talent connecting with companies eager to hire smart workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For companies looking for staffing solutions, video interviewing could be the key to success. Whether you're looking to connect with candidates in real time or cut down on the temporary staffing process, it's time to embrace new technology and make great hires!&lt;/p&gt;</value>

  </data>
  <data name="successfulEntrepreneursDescription" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;Hiring new recruits for your startup company is never easy. As the founder of a new venture, you're likely spending most of your time trying to secure funding and looking for business opportunities so your fledgling company can grow. Hiring might be the furthest thing from your mind, but eventually all startup companies realize it's time to bring emploee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, hiring top talent on a tight startup budget is far from a simple task. It can also be a time-consuming prospect. As a startup founder, you still have to focus on growing the company and coming up with smart business ideas. You don't want to spend all your time hunting top talent when you could be scaling your business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where the Live interview can really help startup founders become successful entrepreneurs. By cutting down the traditional hiring process, the video interview can help founders connect personally with top talent faster, saving time and money in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Successful entrepreneurs know you need more than great business ideas to grow into a strong company. Eventually, success will require bringing on a team to help with the day-to-day functions of your new startup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Know when to hire. One of the biggest mistakes made by startup companies is premature scaling. All the business opportunities in the world won't matter if you rush into hiring before you're ready. Before jumping into the hiring process with both feet, ask yourself if it's really time to bring more people into the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how can the video interview help startup companies hire the best without missing out on important business opportunities? Here are some ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Video Interviews Save Money&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good company leaders are always looking for new business opportunities, especially when it comes to funding. You might end up spending much of your time looking for angel investors or navigating complicated business startup loans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the funding shuffle, you certainly don't want to lose money in the hiring process. And startup recruitment doesn't have to be an endless process: Video interviews save valuable time and money by shortening the traditional hiring process for cash-strapped founders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, recorded video interviews can save plenty of time in the recruitment process. In a recorded interview, written questions posed by employers are answered on video by candidates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a startup environment, time is money. Spending less time connecting with candidates all wrong for the job will save founders plenty of cash they can invest back into the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connect Personally and Focus on Company Culture&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Company culture is essential when it comes to startup recruitment. As a founder, it's your job to create the personality, environment, and company culture of your startup. Whether you're just beginning to hire or you're a recruitment pro, it's important to keep company culture in mind while looking at top prospects. Knowing how expensive employee turnover can be, it's important to focus only on the candidates who can make a positive contribution to your startup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Video interviews allow you to connect faster and more personally with great candidates. If someone doesn't impress in a one-way video interview, you can easily move onto the next talented candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, video interviews allow you to cross great distances and still connect. With live video interviews, you can talk in real-time with candidates all over the world, helping startup founders easily jump the skills gap.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

    <value>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take more revenue with video interviewing for staffing firms &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="takeMoreRevenueWithVideoDescription" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;The way in which most staffing firms measure their success is by looking at the number of candidate placements they make. Ultimately, a staffing firm&amp;rsquo;s revenue will grow as their number of placements increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are examples of how utilizing video interviewing technology will help your staffing firm improve its recruiting strategies to drive more revenue:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expand Your Candidate Area&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s crucial that staffing professionals have an ongoing candidates area from which they can pull candidates from for any given position that opens up at a client&amp;rsquo;s company. With video interviews, you can build a digital library of talent to achieve this. If a candidate didn&amp;rsquo;t work out for one client, you will have their video interview on file to potentially fill another client&amp;rsquo;s position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being able to look at previous job candidates&amp;rsquo; video interviews can speed up the time it takes staffing pros to find and place right candidate. You&amp;rsquo;ll be spending less time trying to dig up notes on a particular candidate and more time placing them at an organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enhance Collaboration with Clients&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having candidates complete recorded interviews or participate in a live interview, allows you to share the recordings with your clients to review. This will greatly enhance collaboration which will lead to your clients having the chance to make better hiring decisions. Your clients will be able to see candidates the way you see them so you can gain more insight on their needs and expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reviewing candidates&amp;rsquo; recorded interviews, your clients can outline exactly what they like and don&amp;rsquo;t like about them which will help you provide top candidate and further set yourself apart from competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By working with candidates in this way to ensure they&amp;rsquo;re properly showcasing their personality and skills to clients, you can position your staffing firm as one that highly values its candidates and will do anything possible to place them at great organizations. These candidates may then recommend others to work with your company. More candidates working with your company means having a better chance of finding the best potential hires for your clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using video interviews at your staffing firm will help you to consistently deliver great candidates for you clients to hire. This will increase their trust and their desire to continue working with your staffing firm.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

  <data name="theBenefitsOfVIDescription" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re most likely very familiar with the traditional job interview where you meet with a employer or hiring manager face-to-face in their office. Nowadays, companies are implementing video interviews into their hiring process to better and quickly connect with candidates. The recorded interview, in particular, is used by many Live Interview customers for the early stage of their interview process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are answers to questions that you may have about your video interview so you can fully prepare:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will there be someone else on the other end?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recorded video interview only you, the job seeker, are present and doing all the talking. The interview questions will be presented to you in either text or video form. Once you have recorded and submitted your responses, the employer or hiring manager will review your interview on their own time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When is my recorded interview due? How long do I have to complete it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The due date for your one-way interview is set by the employer or hiring manager who invited you. The amount of time that you have to complete it depends on the date and the time they have chosen for the interview to be completed by. You can find this information on the landing page for your recorded interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where should I do my interview?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally, you should record your recorded interview in a quiet area with no other people around. A employer or hiring manager will not appreciate being distracted by people coming in and out of the room you recorded in. The company wants to know more about you, therefore, you need to be the sole focus of the video interview. It&amp;rsquo;s also important to make sure that the space you are recording in looks clean and professional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if I don&amp;rsquo;t have a webcam? Can I use my phone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t have access to a computer and webcam, you can conveniently complete your recorded interview by using your mobile device. Just simply download the mobile app and you&amp;rsquo;re ready to go! The mobile app supports iOS or Android devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many questions are there? Do I see the questions ahead of time? How much time do I have to answer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of questions for a recorded interview is decided by the employer or hiring manager. Once you start the interview, you will be told the number of questions you will need to answer. The questions will be presented to you one at a time so you will have an opportunity to think about your response before recording.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many times can I re-record?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anything can happen. Maybe your dog suddenly jumped onto your lap as you were halfway through a response. Or you suddenly got tongue-tied. Whatever the case may be, you will have the ability to re-record a response. However, don&amp;rsquo;t get caught up trying to perfectly record your responses and note that the new answers will automatically delete the previous entry.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

  <data name="thingsToAvoid" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things to avoid in your video interview &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="thingsToAvoidDescription" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;Your goals for a traditional interview (where you meet a recruiter or hiring manager face-to-face in their office) should be no different from your goals for a video interview. You should still be aiming to present yourself as a desirable candidate. Here are some tips that will guide you from potentially making any mistakes in your recorded interview that could cost you a job:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read the instructions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s always important to thoroughly read instructions provided to you, especially if you&amp;rsquo;re about to do something that you may not be totally familiar with. If you carefully read the recorded interview instructions, you can avoid delays in completing your interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having people in the room with you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try your best to find a quiet, private area to record your interview. If there are other people in the room or nearby, it can be a distraction to you and to the hiring manager reviewing your interview. The focus should solely be on you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recording with no audio&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are using a computer to complete your record, make sure to verify the microphone you are using before recording. Additionally, you should always play back your first recorded answer to make certain that your audio and webcam are working properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recording without seeing yourself on the screen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t see yourself on the screen when recording, that means your webcam isn&amp;rsquo;t properly connected or verified. Don&amp;rsquo;t make the mistake of continuing to record if this is the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recording in a messy space&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be conscious of what the background of your video will say about your candidacy. Make sure to record in an area that looks clean and professional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not speaking clearly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t force a recruiter or hiring manager to turn up the volume or strain their ears to hear your answers to their interview questions. Speak loudly and clearly so that you can be understood. It would be a shame for your recorded interview to be passed over just because the person reviewing it had no idea what you were saying.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting too comfortable&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great thing about recorded interviews is that they&amp;rsquo;re convenient for both employers and job seekers. You can complete your one-way from anywhere via your mobile phone or from the comfort of your own home using a computer and webcam. However, you should still be professional and treat the recorded interview as if it were a traditional in-office interview. Dress appropriately from head to toe; don&amp;rsquo;t pair your dress shirt and blazer with pajama pants and slippers. Also, now&amp;rsquo;s not the time to get cozy in your favorite armchair. Be aware of your posture and make sure you are sitting up straight to show that you are confident and taking the interview seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being unprepared&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your preparation for a recorded interview should be no different from how you prepare for an in-person interview. Rehearse your responses to the interview questions so you can sound natural and sincere when you&amp;rsquo;re ready to record.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

    <value>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tips on body language for your video interview &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="tipsOnBodyLanguageDescription" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;It's essential to make sure that you are put together and looking your best for a recorded interview, but you should also give equal importance to having good body language. You must to be conscious of your body language to make certain that you are presenting yourself in the best way possible throughout the entire interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Communication is 55% body language. Even if you are not speaking a single word, you are communicating. Everything about your body language conveys something about you; whether you are nervous, confident, proud, annoyed, humble, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Establish eye contact&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maintaining eye contact in a video interview may seem tricky and even awkward, but it is possible and necessary. When recording your rvideo interview, be sure to look straight into the webcam - do not look at yourself on the screen. Imagine that there is a person sitting across from you listening to your answers. When you look into the webcam, the employer/hiring manager who will be reviewing your interview will feel more engaged because it&amp;rsquo;s as if you&amp;rsquo;re looking at them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sit up straight&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having good posture in an interview is very important. Slouching or leaning back in your seat may give off the vibe that you aren&amp;rsquo;t taking the interview seriously or are bored and disinterested. Crossing your arms should also be avoided because you&amp;rsquo;ll appear unapproachable and defensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoid moving too much&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people have a lot of nervous energy, they tend to shake their legs, move their hands around a lot, or tap their fingers on the table. Try your best to avoid movements that may convey that you&amp;rsquo;re nervous and may be distracting to the employer/hiring manager reviewing your interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smile!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may feel nervous and stressed during your video interview, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to show in your face. A smile can hide your insecurities and nerves, but also make you seem approachable. Be sure to smile and show the employer/hiring manager how friendly and pleasant you are.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

  <data name="videoInterviewingTipsDescription" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;Video interviewing is much like having an in person interview. Video allows job seekers to get some much needed time with recruiters and hiring managers. So make sure you make the most of this time with some simple tips on how to impress in your video interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speak Clearly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've talked about the importance of communication skills and here is the perfect place to show off those skills. You might be nervous but now is not the time to let the nervs to get in your way. Your dream job could be just one Live Interview away, after all.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set the Stage&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staging is important for an effective virtual interview, whether you&amp;rsquo;re answering questions or speaking live to a hiring manager. Look behind you, is your backdrop ready? If the background of your video is cluttered you&amp;rsquo;re sending the wrong message. Your verbal and nonverbal cues could be great but your staging is telling a different story. Make sure to find a well-lit, professional, and clean space for your interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dress for Success&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think just because it&amp;rsquo;s an interview online you can skip the suit? Think again! Employers are going to be judging you just as they would if you met them in person. What you wear tells employers important information about who you are. More specifically, it tells employers just how serious you are about the job, so dress professionally.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prepare!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important part of any video interview (or any interview in general) is preparation. Research the company and practice answering common interview questions. If you prepare for your interview you&amp;rsquo;ll be well on your way to landing your dream job!&lt;/p&gt;

    <value>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Video Interviews for staffing: better representation of candidates to clients&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="videoInterviewsForStaffingDescription" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;An obvious benefit of video interviews for staffing companies is that it allows recruiters to connect with the usually hard-to-reach candidates, such as non-local and passive. Passive candidates usually already have a full-time job and don&amp;rsquo;t have time in their schedule to fit in driving to another office for an interview. Trying to schedule an in-person interview with a candidate who lives in another country or even just the next town over can be the cause of headaches as well. There are travel costs to consider along with differing time-zones. Furthermore, uncontrollable things, such as weather and traffic, can prevent an in-person interview from happening at all which means having to reschedule and will delaying a hiring decision being made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Video interviews provide the flexibility to work around a candidate&amp;rsquo;s busy schedule. That passive candidate can record their interview at the end of a long work day in the comfort of their home using a webcam or mobile device. You can connect with far-flung candidates in real-time, face-to-face with the live interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For staffing, the advantages to using this technology go beyond the ability to efficiently connect with local and non-passive candidates. Video interviewing is a powerful tool that will help staffing companies more efficiently place candidates at clients&amp;rsquo; companies where they can excel and contribute immensely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Video interviewing is the ultimate marketing tool available to staffing companies. It provides a better way for recruiters to present candidates to clients so they can conveniently see for themselves if someone has the right communication skills and attitude to fit in at their organization. Your clients will appreciate how much insight they&amp;rsquo;ll gain on a candidate by watching their video interviews. They&amp;rsquo;ll have peace of mind knowing that their new hire won&amp;rsquo;t be a big mistake they&amp;rsquo;ll regret later on. Furthermore, their trust in your staffing company to provide top-notch candidates will grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, video interviews are a value prop to candidates that can increase their chances of getting a job offer. Through recorded video interviews, a candidate can give companies an accurate look at the type of professional they are. By utilizing video interviews, recruiters are showing their candidates that they value them and that their priority is to position them in the best light to potential employers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utilizing video interviews enables staffing companies to ensure that their talent pool is always full of great candidates who have the potential to be great hires for clients. Specifically, the recorded interviews can help staffing companies to boost their revenue by establishing strong, long-lasting relationships with their clients who can rely on them to deliver great talent when needed.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

  <data name="audioTroubleshootingDescription" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;The following factors are the most important ones to consider when optimizing your live video interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Browser&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Internet Connection&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Microphone and Speakers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Using a Headset&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Other Applications&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Browser support&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We supported the recent versions of the:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mozilla Firefox&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Chrome&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Safari&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet Explorer (There is lot issues with Internet Explorer and video streaming. So, this is our least preferred browser.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet Connection&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;A good internet connection is required for a successful Live Interview. It is suggested that you are directly connected to the internet through a cable not via WiFi. Using a direct connection will ensure that you have the best possible bandwidth available and reduces latency issues to a minimum. This will result in better picture and audio quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microphone and Speakers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When beginning your Live Interview, it can be helpful to keep your microphone volume low, and adjust it once you have entered the interview. It is also helpful to keep your speaker volume low when you first begin, and adjust it after entering your interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a Headset&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A headset can reduce feedback from your speakers entering an open microphone. If you experience a lot of echoing and have adjusted your microphone input and speaker output, another alternative is to use a headset or headphones. This can improve the interview experience in some situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other Applications&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Close all applications other than Live Interview that use your webcam and microphone. These applications such as Skype and FaceTime may interfere with Live Interview's ability to leverage your webcam and microphone.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

&lt;p&gt;Selecting a webcam&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When selecting a webcam, make sure you can see yourself in the video preview before you enter a Live Interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ensure your webcam is properly installed on your computer before participating in a Live Interview.&lt;/p&gt;
